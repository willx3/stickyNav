stickyNav
=========

Simple code for a fixed position "sticky" nav bar when scrolling down.



A nice effect for your nav bar to stick to the top of the screen once you have scrolled a certain width.

Just get the height of your nav bar and then change that in the Jquery and enjoy the sticky nav goodness!
